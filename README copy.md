# What is this Repo?

<p>This project is a mock news app. The backend was created by myself and details on this can be found in the link below.
The front end takes all of the data and displays it in a user friendly site. You can view articles, filter them by topics, sort them by many queries and view each article individually. By default, you are logged in as a user so can vote and comment on different articles and other users comments.
